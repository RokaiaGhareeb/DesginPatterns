# DesginPatterns
playing around with some Design patterns using my favourite sport as an example to understand them :soccer: :hearts:
<br>
 implmented using C# :computer:

## List of the included patterns 

- Observer design pattern to keep tracking the :soccer: by the referee and players :eyes:

Here the ball is the subject (publisher) and the refree and players are the subscribers (observers) <br>
You can learn more from here : https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/observer <br> <br>

- Strategy design pattern to switch my strategy depending on the game inputs ! We have to attack to win now :mega:

Here the team strategy is the strategy interface that is implemented by strategies like Attack or Defend <br>

- Decorator design pattern to change my players abilities and position - I have a midfilder that can be a very good forward :alien: - 

Here the player (component interface) can be field player or goalkeeper both can baiscally passBall () and can be wrapped bu other abilities like being forward or defender or both (Dedorators) <br>

List will be updated soon with builder design pattern to describe our playground :golf: :fire:
